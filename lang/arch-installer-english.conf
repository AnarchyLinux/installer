### arch-installer-<language-here>.conf
###
### You may send any completed translations to the developer for it to be included in the next release:
###

### Do not remove any occurrence of \n or \n\n this tells program to create a new line and should not be changed
### Do not remove any special characters such as *, or quotes.
### Do not edit the names of the functions example main_msg() or remove any function brackets: { }
### Do not edit any varibles within the text for example: /dev/$DRIVE and: $user
