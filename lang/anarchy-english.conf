### anarchy-english.conf
### By: Deadhead (Dylan Schacht)
###
### This is the language file for Anarchy Linux.
### This file is sourced at the beginning of the install based of the language you select
### If you would like to help out in translating this file into your language you can easily do so by changing the variables
###
### Enter the name of the translator "By:" and any notes you would like to include in above comments
### Please save your finished translation in the following format:
###
### anarchy-<language-here>.conf
###
### You may send any completed translations to the developer for it to be included in the next release:
###
### deadhead3492@gmail.com
###
### First change this variable to the correct utf-8 locale for your language.
### Example: en_GB.UTF-8, pt_PT.UTF-8, ru_RU.UTF-8, ro_RO.UTF-8

LANG="en_US.UTF-8"

### Important: Please be sure you are using UTF-8 encoding before beginning the translation!
### Do not change the variable names for example intro_msg=
### Do not remove any occurrence of \n or \n\n this tells program to create a new line and should not be changed
### Do not remove any special characters such as $a, or quotes.
### Do not edit the names of the functions example main_msg() or remove any function brackets: { }
### Do not edit any variables within the text for example: /dev/$DRIVE and: $user
###
### NOTE: Translations for additional software / desktops can be found in: etc/anarchy.conf
### The additional translations may be added to this translation file
### You may translate any full words contained between the quotes ""
### Translations begin here:

### New lines to translate will be added here. Do not remove these functions
### You may, if you wish, add lines to other functions after translation
